# CODE COVERAGE
Code coverage is a measure that determines how much of the actual source code is tested. It is frequently necessary to assess the testing process's quality.
During lectures, I learnt about several types of coverage approaches.

## Statement coverage
The fundamental purpose of statement coverage is to cover all available paths, lines, and statements in source code.
Using statement coverage, a scenario is constructed based on the structure of the code. This is a type of white-box testing.

## Branch Coverage

The branch coverage approach is used to cover all branches of the control flow graph. Each decision point condition is addressed at least once. This white box testing approach ensures that each branch of each decision point is carried out.

## Condition coverage

Condition or predicate coverage is a testing technique used to examine and evaluate the variables or sub-expressions in a conditional statement. The goal of condition coverage is to examine individual results for each logical condition. Control flow is frequently more sensitive to condition coverage.
